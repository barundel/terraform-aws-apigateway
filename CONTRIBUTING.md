# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project!

We use *GitHub Issues* for trackings issues and features. You can make a contribution by:

1. Reporting an issue or making a feature request [here](https://github.com/barundel/terraform-aws-apigateway/issues).
2. Contributing code to this project by fixing an issue or adding a new feature (see below).

Before contributing a new feature, please discuss its suitability with the project maintainers in an issue first. Thanks!

## Contribution Process

1. Fork and *git clone* [the-reop](https://github.com/barundel/terraform-aws-apigateway).
2. Create a new *git branch* from the master branch where you develop your changes.
3. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for your contribution by following the instructions in the pull request template.
4. Perform a code review with the project maintainers on the pull request. We may suggest changes, improvements or alternatives.
5. Once approved, your code will be merged into `master` and your name will be included in `AUTHORS`.

### Requirements

Pull requests have to meet the following requirements:

2. **Documentation**: Pull requests need to update the [documentation](https://github.com/barundel/terraform-aws-apigateway/tree/master/README.md) together with the code change.

3. **Commits**: Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit compiles and passes tests independently. [Write good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). If needed, [squash your commits](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git) prior to submission.
